    Given a case that has just been created as in [F-13010.1_CreateCase],
    And the RoleToAccessProfiles tab [contains CaseAccessCategory with pattern - Civil/Standard, Criminal/Serious]
    And the case [C1 contains an CaseAccessCategory field value as Civil/Standard/Legal]
    When a request is prepared with appropriate values
    And the request [attempts to get the previously created case]
    Then a positive response is received,
    And the response has all the details as expected

  @S-13010.2 @Ignore
  Scenario: RoleToAccessProfiles mapping for user’s derived AccessProfile contains category, case contains category value NOT starting with defined pattern, Access is not Granted
    Given a case that has just been created as in [F-13010.2_CreateCase],

    And the case [C1 contains an CaseAccessCategory field value as FamilyLaw/Standard]
