Feature: F-122: Conditional Event Post States
#==============================================
#  Tests 1-3 use updateCase event with the post state condition:
#  CaseCreated -> CaseUpdated(TextField="updated" AND EmailField="*"):1;CaseAmended(TextField="amended" AND EmailField="*"):2;CaseRevoked(AddressField.AddressLine1="revoked" AND EmailField="*"):3;CaseDeleted
#
#  Tests 4-7 use updateCase2 event with the post state condition:
#  CaseCreated -> CaseUpdated2(TextField="updated2" OR EmailField="*"):1;CaseAmended2(TextField="amended2" OR EmailField="matched@test.com"):2;*(TextField="keepstate"):3;CaseRevoked2(EmailField!=""):4;CaseDeleted

  Background: Load test data for the scenario
    Given an appropriate test context as detailed in the test data source
