Feature: F-1007: GlobalSearch - AC Case Access Categories

  Background: Load test data for the scenario
    Given an appropriate test context as detailed in the test data source
    And a successful call [to create the global search index] as in [GlobalSearchIndexCreation]

  @S-1007.1 @AC1
  Scenario: Successfully search for case with the new global search parameters and case access category value starting with defined CaseAccessCategories pattern in the RolesToAccessProfiles tab, case should be returned
    Given a user with [an active profile in CCD]
    And a successful call [to create a case] as in [S-1007.1_CreateCase]
    And a wait time of [5] seconds [to allow for Logstash to index the case just created]
    When a request is prepared with appropriate values,
    And [the RoleToAccessProfiles tab contains CaseAccessCategory with pattern Civil Standard, Criminal Serious] in the context,
    And [the case C1 contains a CaseAccessCategory field value of Civil/Standard/Legal] in the context,
    And the request [contains all the mandatory parameters],
    And it is submitted to call the [Global Search] operation of [CCD Data Store],
    Then a positive response is received,
    And the response [has 200 return code],
    And the response [contains case C1],
    And the response has all other details as expected.

  @S-1007.2  @AC2
  Scenario: Unsuccessful search for case with the new global search parameters, case contains category value NOT starting with defined CaseAccessCategories pattern, case should NOT be returned
    Given a user with [an active profile in CCD]
    And a successful call [to create a case] as in [S-1007.2_CreateCase]
    And a wait time of [5] seconds [to allow for Logstash to index the case just created]
    When a request is prepared with appropriate values,
    And [the RoleToAccessProfiles tab contains CaseAccessCategory with pattern - Civil/Standard, Criminal/Serious] in the context,
    And [the case C1 contains an CaseAccessCategory field value as FamilyLaw/Standard] in the context,
    And the request [contains all the mandatory parameters],
    And it is submitted to call the [Global Search] operation of [CCD Data Store],
    Then a positive response is received,
    And the response [has 200 return code],
    And the response [returns 0 cases],
    And the response has all other details as expected.

  @S-1007.3  @AC3
  Scenario:  Unsuccessful search, Case contains NO category value but RolesToAccessProfiles contains CaseAccessCategories, case should NOT be returned when Global Search invoked for cases
    Given a user with [an active profile in CCD],
    And a successful call [to create a case] as in [S-1007.3_CreateCase]
    And a wait time of [5] seconds [to allow for Logstash to index the case just created]
    When a request is prepared with appropriate values,
    And [the RoleToAccessProfiles tab contains CaseAccessCategory with pattern - Civil/Standard, Criminal/Serious] in the context,
    And [the case C1 contains an CaseAccessCategory field value as NULL] in the context,
    And the request [contains all the mandatory parameters],
    And it is submitted to call the [Global Search] operation of [CCD Data Store],
    Then a positive response is received,
    And the response [has 200 return code],
    And the response [returns 0 cases],
    And the response has all other details as expected.

  @S-1007.4  @AC4
  Scenario:  Successfully search for case with the new global search parameters and case access category for case has non-null value, CaseAccessCategories pattern in the RolesToAccessProfiles tab is NULL, case should be returned
    Given a user with [an active profile in CCD],
    And a successful call [to create a case] as in [S-1007.4_CreateCase]
    And a wait time of [5] seconds [to allow for Logstash to index the case just created]
    When a request is prepared with appropriate values,
    And [the RoleToAccessProfiles tab contains CaseAccessCategory with NULL value] in the context,
    And [the case C1 contains a CaseAccessCategory field value of Civil/Standard/Legal] in the context,
    And the request [contains all the mandatory parameters],
    And it is submitted to call the [Global Search] operation of [CCD Data Store],
    Then a positive response is received,
    And the response [has 200 return code],
    And the response [contains case C1],
    And the response has all other details as expected.

  @S-1007.5  @AC5
  Scenario:  RoleToAccessProfiles mapping for userâ€™s derived AccessProfiles contains multiple categories plus at least one which has NO category, case contains category value NOT matching the start of any of those, case should be returned (because the AccessProfile with NO category overrides)
    And a user with [an active profile in CCD],
    And a successful call [to create a case] as in [S-1007.5_CreateCase]
    And a wait time of [5] seconds [to allow for Logstash to index the case just created]
    When a request is prepared with appropriate values,
    And [the RoleToAccessProfiles tab contains CaseAccessCategory with NULL value] in the context,
    And [the RoleToAccessProfiles tab contains CaseAccessCategory with Civil/Standard, Criminal/Standard value] in the context,
    And [the case C1 contains an CaseAccessCategory field value as FamilyLaw/Standard] in the context,
    And the request [contains all the mandatory parameters],
    And it is submitted to call the [Global Search] operation of [CCD Data Store],
    Then a positive response is received,
    And the response [has 200 return code],
    And the response [contains case C1],
    And the response has all other details as expected.
