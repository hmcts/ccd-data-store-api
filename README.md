### Building

The project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/).

To build project please execute the following:

```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

### Running

If you want your code to become available to other Docker projects (e.g. for local environment testing), you need to build the image:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

The above will build both the application and database images.  
If you want to build only one of them just specify the name assigned in docker compose file, e.g.:

```bash
docker-compose build ccd-data-store-api
```

When the project has been packaged in `target/` directory, 
you can run it by executing following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

As a result the following containers will get created and started:

 - Database exposing port `5452`
 - API exposing ports `4452`

#### Handling database

Database will get initiated when you run `docker-compose up` for the first time by execute all scripts from `database` directory.

You don't need to migrate database manually since migrations are executed every time `docker-compose up` is executed.

You can connect to the database at `http://localhost:5452` with the username and password set in the environment variables.

### Functional Tests
The functional tests are located in `aat` folder. These are the tests run against an environment. For example if you would 
like to test your local environment you'll need to export the following variables on your `.bash_profile` script. You'll 


```bash
#Smoke/Functional Tests
export TEST_URL=http://localhost:4452
export S2S_URL=http://localhost:4502
export CCD_GW_SERVICE_NAME=ccd_gw
export CCD_GW_SERVICE_SECRET=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC
export CCD_CASEWORKER_AUTOTEST_EMAIL=someemail@blob.com
export CCD_CASEWORKER_AUTOTEST_PASSWORD=XYZT
```

These tests also rely on the `CCD_CNP_27.xlsx` file to be already imported. The latest version of this file could be found 
in [ccd-definition-store-api](https://github.com/hmcts/ccd-definition-store-api) project under the `aat/src/resource` folder. You may want to import it to your local installation 
before trying to run the functional tests against your local environment.
